Seriously like... how did you write this so fast and so well? Holy guacamole. The progression is so happy and fun, the melodies are amazingly enjoyable, the mixing is top quality! HOW DID YOU DO THIS. It's tough not to just shower this piece with praise. The only thing that I'm not totally sold on is the "story-like" aspect of the piece - it makes it hard to just binge listen to this song 500 times in a row (which is exactly what I'd otherwise do) since it's kind of disjointed.
I have a slight suspicion as to who this could be, but if so, consider me blown away. This is miles ahead of your other (excellent) material! It kind of reminds me of when dem0lecule submitted Sunset Silicon Sector and I almost didn't even think it was him because it was such an improvement on so many fronts. WOW wowo wowowowowowo
(the writing of the story is also really good too lol)
("you throw your clock across the room" never fails to make me laugh)
(only critique: sax is too dry)
