chip section is amazing unsurprisingly
the 1:28 motif is so good! i can't remember hearing such a good motif on chips recently, except some stuff by @ectisity. i actually got mad when the song basically transformed into an entirely different idea like 5 seconds later. Y WOULD U DO THIS TO ME >:(
i kind of wish that the entire song was just an expansion of the chip idea tbh i feel like the song sacrifices a tad when going for that flavor.
