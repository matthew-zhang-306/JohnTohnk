I take back what I said earlier about the piece being too "story-like". The way that this piece fits so absolutely perfectly to its description has pretty much obliterated all my hesitations. Like the way that the first time the pencil drops, the sax doesn't do anything, but the second time it does a little melody, and by the end it plays a super smooth and nice melody. Or the way that the sax and violin harmonize in the end when "you sit down at Câ€™s table during lunch and have a normal, real interaction".
I encourage anyone who's listening to this piece to line up every sentence with a part of the song. The way you translate story into music has put the biggest smile on my face.
